Rubber-tree-stone-cells

This repository contains the dataset and model weights for high-precision segmentation and phenotypic analysis of rubber tree stone cells.

Dataset

The dataset consists of annotated images of rubber tree bark sections, containing stone cells. Due to the large size of the images in the dataset, only a subset of the data is uploaded here as a sample. If you require more data for your work, please feel free to contact me, and I will be happy to send the additional dataset via email.

You can use this dataset for training segmentation models on rubber tree stone cells.

Model Weights

The provided model weights represent the best-performing weights obtained from training the segmentation network on the rubber tree stone cells dataset. These weights are optimized for high-precision segmentation and can be used for further evaluation or fine-tuning on your own dataset.

How to Use

Download the dataset and place it in the 'data/' folder.

Use the provided Python script to train or test the model.

For any questions, or if you need the complete dataset, please feel free to contact me via email at 20232322@csuft.edu.cn. I am more than happy to provide the additional images upon request.
