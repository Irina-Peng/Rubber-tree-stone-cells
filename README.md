# Rubber-tree-stone-cells

This repository contains the dataset and model weights for high-precision segmentation and phenotypic analysis of rubber tree stone cells.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of annotated images of rubber tree bark sections, containing stone cells.
- You can use this dataset for training segmentation models on rubber tree stone cells.

## Model Weights
- The provided model weights represent the **best-performing weights** obtained from training the segmentation network on the rubber tree stone cells dataset.
- These weights are optimized for high-precision segmentation and can be used for further evaluation or fine-tuning on your own dataset.

## How to use
1. Download the dataset and place it in the 'data/' folder.
2. Use the provided Python script to train or test the model.
3. For any questions, contact [Your Contact Information].
